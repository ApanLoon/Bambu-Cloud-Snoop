# Bambu-Cloud-Snoop

Connects to the Bambu Lab cloud service and downloads the project history. Unfortunately, I don't know how to download all project files. Ideally I'd want to download the actual 3mf-file that would be sent to the printer. Also, my print history was abnormally truncated in March of 2025 for unknown reasons.
